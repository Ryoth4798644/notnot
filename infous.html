                    A project created by Internet users Panica, bdkt and blednay. 4-14+ sells exclusive content, which is very difficult to get on the Internet; you can get it in a couple of clicks. Our project does not violate absolutely anything, all content is encrypted to avoid problems!

                    4-14+ was created by me "Panic". in 2023, initially in the form of a forum on the Telegram platform. Afterwards, we noticed that our project began to be actively banned due to some violations of the Telegram platform. Because of fucking bans, we switched to a new platform called Discord, a server was created on this platform that was able to reach 2000 participants, after which the Discord platform also began to monitor our project, because of which we again lost the opportunity to publish our project, but only in Discord. The server you are on now is one of my most successful developments. This site was created in 2024!
